- **Anomaly Detection**: Leverage Machine Learning to identify patterns that may indicate issues.
- **User-Friendly Interface**: Designed for ease of use with visual representations of the log data.
- **Integration with MongoDB Atlas**: Store and manage data efficiently.
- **RESTful API Support**: Interact with the application programmatically.
  
## 📝 Usage Instructions
After successfully running the application, here are steps to follow:

1. Open your web browser.
2. Navigate to `http://localhost:8080` to access the interface.
3. Upload your log files using the designated upload button.
4. Review the results generated by the application.

## 🔧 Troubleshooting
- **Application Doesn’t Start**:
  - Ensure Docker is running if you chose that option.
  - Check that all required dependencies, such as Java and Maven, are installed properly.
